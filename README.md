# better-role-bot
A better way of handling roles.

A combination of Vuetify, JS and Discord for prettier role management

# Road Map

- API
  - Get roles
  - Add roles to categories
  - Manage category permissions
  - Set roles to self
- Bot
  - Link to site
  - Edit roles
    - `] role <Role Name>`
  - Show roles
- Site
  - Interfacey stuff
  - Vuetified

# Rules

1. "Colour" not "Color"
2. 2-space indenting

## Credits
Based on the concept of RoleyPoley (Discord app), but done better because they keep breaking it. And then it spouts Japanese at me. Our error messages will be much better.
